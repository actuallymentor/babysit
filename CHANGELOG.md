# Changelog

## 0.3.3 — 2026-04-29

### 🐛 Fixed
- Codex was reading nothing from babysit's system prompt — the prompt was being written to `${CODEX_HOME}/instructions.md`, a legacy filename current codex no longer honors. The real global-scope path is `${CODEX_HOME}/AGENTS.md` (or `AGENTS.override.md`), so the babysit-generated prompt has been silently dropped on every codex session since v0.3.0. Switched to the correct filename.

### ✨ Added
- Each agent adapter now declares an `home: { env_var, dir }` block — `CODEX_HOME` for codex, `GEMINI_CLI_HOME` for gemini, `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` for claude, `OPENCODE_CONFIG_DIR` for opencode. `build_docker_command` bakes the env var into the docker run, so babysit has a single source of truth for where the agent reads global instructions / credentials / sessions from. This also stops a stray host-side value from leaking through and redirecting the agent to a path the container never mounts.

### ✅ Tests
- New `tests/docker.test.js` cases assert that each adapter's home env var is set in the rendered docker command and that the `system_prompt_file` lives under the declared `home.dir`. The codex case explicitly rejects `instructions.md` to lock in the bug fix.

## 0.3.2 — 2026-04-29

### 🐛 Fixed
- Codex was launched at the wrong reasoning effort in yolo runs — `-c reasoning_effort=high` is silently ignored by codex (the real config key is `model_reasoning_effort`). Switched to `-c model_reasoning_effort="high"`.
- Codex skip-permissions was `--full-auto`, which only skips approvals — its workspace-write sandbox stayed active and blocked edits inside our own docker sandbox. Switched to `--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox` so `babysit codex --yolo` actually has full autonomy.
- Default codex model `gpt-5-codex` was not a real model id. Updated to `gpt-5.5` (the latest GA frontier model as of April 2026; users on API-key auth without ChatGPT sign-in can override with `--model gpt-5.4`).
- Default gemini model was the now-superseded `gemini-2.5-pro`. Switched to the rolling `gemini-pro-latest` alias so the spec's "always auto-selects ... latest model" rule keeps holding.
- Container `PATH` didn't include `~/.local/bin` or `~/.opencode/bin`, the install paths used by claude's and opencode's install scripts — `claude`/`opencode` would have resolved to "command not found" at runtime.
- Credential refresh interval kept the event loop alive — if the user interrupted the cli before the tmux session ended, the process would hang on the unfired `setInterval`. Now `unref()`'d.

### 🔥 Removed
- Orphaned mode helpers `src/modes/{yolo,sandbox,mudbox}.js`. They mutated a `context` object that no caller ever passes — the actual mode application is inlined in `docker/run.js` and `modes/prompt.js`.

### ✅ Tests
- `tests/docker.test.js` updated for the corrected codex defaults (effort key, skip-permissions flag, model id) and now asserts `model_reasoning_effort="high"` survives shell-quoting into a single arg.

## 0.3.1 — 2026-04-28

### 🐛 Fixed
- `--no-update` was silently ignored — mri normalises `--no-X` to `{X:false}` rather than `{'no-X':true}`, so `args['no-update']` always missed. Self-update ran on every command, including when the user explicitly opted out
- Compiled binary crashed on startup with `ENOENT: /$bunfs/package.json` — version was read at runtime via `readFileSync(__dirname/../package.json)`, but bun-compiled binaries resolve `__dirname` to `/$bunfs`. Switched to JSON import attribute so the file embeds at build time
- Compiled binary crashed when building the system prompt — `src/modes/prompt.js` read `system_prompt/*.md` via the same `__dirname`+`readFileSync` pattern. Converted the fragments to JS-exported string constants in `src/system_prompt/index.js` so they bundle into the binary

### 🔥 Removed
- `get_statusline_path` — unused export with the same `__dirname`/`readFileSync` issue. The container's statusline.sh path is hard-coded into the Claude settings tmpfile, so the function had no callers
- `src/system_prompt/{base,yolo,sandbox,mudbox}.md` — content moved into `src/system_prompt/index.js`

### ✅ Tests
- New `tests/prompt.test.js` covers each mode flag → fragment combination
- New `parse.test.js` cases lock in `--no-update` recognition

## 0.3.0 — 2026-04-28

### 🐛 Fixed
- Docker image namespace mismatch — `src/docker/update.js` was pointing at `babysit/babysit` but the publish workflow ships `actuallymentor/babysit`, so `docker pull` and `docker run` would both fail at runtime
- `codex resume` now uses the interactive subcommand — previously routed through `codex exec resume`, which is non-interactive and can't be supervised through tmux
- `build_docker_command` shell-quotes every value before joining — multi-line system prompts, env values containing spaces / `$` / quotes, and paths with spaces are no longer mangled by `sh -c`
- `parse_args` rejects `--sandbox --mudbox` instead of silently picking one — the mount strategies are contradictory
- `babysit resume <id>` keeps unknown passthrough flags — `--model sonnet` and friends were previously dropped on the agent-less form
- `cmd_resume` errors out informatively when no stored session is found — used to silently fall back to claude

### ✨ Added
- System prompt is now injected for codex / gemini / opencode (previously only claude got one) — passed via `BABYSIT_SYSTEM_PROMPT` env, the entrypoint appends it to the agent-specific config file (`AGENTS.md` for codex/opencode, `GEMINI.md` for gemini)
- Codex defaults: `--model gpt-5-codex` and `-c reasoning_effort=high`, per spec "always auto-selects the maximum effort and latest model"
- `babysit list` and `babysit open` now run the dependency check and self-update pre-flight (with `--no-update` to opt out), per spec "On any babysit command"
- `scripts/install.sh` now offers to install missing dependencies via the detected package manager (brew / apt-get / dnf / pacman) instead of just printing hints

### ♻️ Changed
- `base.md` system-prompt wording aligned with the spec ("Docker container", not "Babysit Docker container")
- `src/tmux/session.js#create_session` no longer accepts an `env` parameter — the dead code path had its own (broken) quoting
- Codex / gemini / opencode adapters now declare a `container_paths.system_prompt_file` so the docker run can target the right path

### ✅ Tests
- New `tests/docker.test.js` covers: docker image name, codex resume shape, system-prompt-file paths, and shell-quoting of values with spaces / quotes / `$`
- Parse test covers sandbox+mudbox rejection and resume passthrough preservation

## 0.2.0 — 2026-04-28

### 🐛 Fixed
- `babysit resume <id>` is now wired to the resume dispatcher (was crashing with "Unknown agent: null")
- `send_shift_tab` now sends the tmux key name `BTab` instead of the unrecognised literal `\x1b[Z`
- `babysit <agent> resume <id>` no longer duplicates the session id between the agent's resume flag and passthrough
- `codex` resume honours the supplied session id (previously always used `--last`)
- `parse_args` no longer halts on the first unknown flag (mri's `unknown` callback returns the callback's value, not the parsed object)
- `send_text` uses tmux `send-keys -l` so `$`, `!`, and backticks pass through as literal text
- `cmd_resume` flag merge — explicit user flags now win over stored modifiers, so `babysit resume <id> --yolo` actually adds yolo

### ✨ Added
- Statusline path is now end-to-end wired: `BABYSIT_MODIFIERS` env, idle countdown file (`/tmp/babysit-loop-deadline`), and a Claude `settings.json` tmpfile that merges host settings with the babysit override (no host mutation)
- `IdleTracker.get_deadline( timeout_s )` publishes the next idle deadline so the statusline can render a countdown
- Self-update pre-flight now also pulls the babysit repo when installed via `git clone`

### ♻️ Changed
- `babysit/yaml.js` now imports `parse_timeout` from `babysit/timeout.js` instead of carrying a near-duplicate inline parser

### ✅ Tests
- New tests for `parse_args` (covers session-id de-duplication and unknown-flag passthrough)
- New tests for `build_claude_settings_tmpfile` and `write_loop_deadline`
- New tests for `IdleTracker.get_deadline`
